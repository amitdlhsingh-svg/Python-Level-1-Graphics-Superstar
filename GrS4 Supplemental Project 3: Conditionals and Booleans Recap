# What are the two booleans?
#True and False

# Write an if statement with a True condition that moves the turtle forward 50 steps.
if 2 == 2:
  bob.forward(50)

# Change your condition to compare 3 and 1 with a comparison operator.
if 3 > 1:
  bob.forward(50)

# Change your condition to use 2 comparison operators and either an and or an or.
if 5>1 and 2 >= 2:
  bob.forward(50)

# This is the code that moves the turtle to a random place and then makes it turn 360 degrees if it is in Qudrant I or II

# Explain how the above code works:
# first the turtle goes to a random position and then when it goes to quadrand 1 or 2 it starts to turn 360 degrees with the code that makes bob turn right ninety dgrees
# Explain how we use an or statement to check if it is in Qudrant I, II, or III
# we use axcor and ycor to see where our turtle is because this code helps to figure out the exact coordinate of each.
