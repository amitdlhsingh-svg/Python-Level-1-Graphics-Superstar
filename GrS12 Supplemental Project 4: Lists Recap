# Explain what a list is:
# a collection of items that show what are used in a situation.


# Make an empty list named turtles
turtles=[]


# Add 3 turtles to turtles
for i in range(3):
  red=turtle.Turtle()
  turtles.append(red)

# Loop through turtles and have each turtle move 50 pixels forward
for turtle in turtles:
    t.forward(50)


# Edit your loop so that the turtles turn a random amount of degrees before going forward
for t in turtles:
    t.right(random.randint(0, 360))
    t.forward(50)



# Explain why lists are useful:
#Because they let you control and store lots of information.
